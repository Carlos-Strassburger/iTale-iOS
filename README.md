##My first iOS app, using what I've been learning on Angela's Yu bootcamp course
With this quickly developed app I got to experiment with the storyboard, MVC architecture aswell as getting to learn more about swift and its peculiarities
## What I liked about this project was that I got to use AI generated images with a few quick prompts to get the logo and the images that show as you progress the short story, if I had to draw or generate by hand it would've taken a long time just to get the images, which wasn't ideal for me in this particular app.
